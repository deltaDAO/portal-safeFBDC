      "content": "The safeFBDC project aims to create a holistic platform concept that encompasses both a trustworthy IT infrastructure and forward-looking AI-driven business models for the financial industry. At the heart of this is a dedicated technology stack that enables sensitive data to be shared teleologically, i.e., for a specific purpose, across organizations. The data owner always decides for which purpose the data may be used, e.g., for specific use cases, centralized or decentralized learning. The interest in the successful realization of safeFBDC is not limited to actors of financial markets; it is intended to serve the greater public good. This is a unique opportunity to establish a strong data ecosystem for the financial services market in Germany and beyond."
