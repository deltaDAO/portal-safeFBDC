**Our vision**Â Our vision of FBDC is a federated ecosystem that provides business, academic, and regulatory stakeholders with a secure, data sovereignty-preserving infrastructure for the exchange and AI-powered mobilization of financial data.

- We develop, prototype, and validate infrastructures for the processing and secure exchange of financial data.
- We ensure that data owners retain sovereignty over their data.
- We develop AI-powered applications to process, exploit, and monetize distributed datasets based on various use case.
- We ensure the compatibility of our structures and developments with the requirements of the markets and with important data structures under development, such as Gaia-X or International Data Spaces.
