The funded project "Investigation of the Suitability of a Financial Big Data Cluster (FBDC) for Securing Data Sovereignty in the Financial Sector" (project acronym "safeFBDC") is part of the BMWi innovation competition "Artificial Intelligence as a Driver for Economically Relevant Ecosystems." **In the European ecosystem** [GAIA-X](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Dossier/gaia-x.html)**, FBDC already represents the central use case in the domain of finance.**

**The core idea of the project is to enable the cross-organizational exchange of data while preserving individual data sovereignty.** Within the proposed project within three years, new AI-based methods are to be researched, developed and prototypically validated based on five domain-specific use cases.

The FBDC company aims at:

- enabling the cross-organisational exchange of data based on decentralized infrastructure
- delivering the required security enhancing techniques
- metadata catalogue and data harmonization tools
